## ‚úÖ Issue #1: Energy Level Options - Full Spectrum

**Problem:** Only showed low options (Slightly/Moderately/Severely low)

**Fixed:** `backend/app/prompts/system_prompts.py`
- Added full energy spectrum:
  - Very high (extremely energized, much more than usual)
  - High (noticeably more energy than usual)  
  - Normal (typical energy levels for you)
  - Slightly low
  - Moderately low
  - Severely low

**Impact:** Now captures mania/hypomania for bipolar screening

## ‚úÖ Issue #2: Screener Introduction Waits for Acknowledgment

**Problem:** Ava asked "Are you ready to begin?" but didn't wait for response

**Fixed:**
1. **`backend/app/services/conversation_service.py`**
   - Added new phase: `SCREENER_INTRO_PENDING`
   - Added `_is_screener_intro()` method to detect introduction
   - Added `_is_acknowledgment()` method to detect patient readiness
   - Auto-generates "Yes, I'm ready" / "I have questions first" buttons
   - Only proceeds to screening after patient confirms

2. **Conversation Flow:**
   ```
   Ava: "...We'll complete PHQ-9, GAD-7, C-SSRS. Are you ready to begin?"
   [System shows buttons: "Yes, I'm ready" | "I have questions first"]
   [System WAITS - Phase: SCREENER_INTRO_PENDING]
   Patient clicks: "Yes, I'm ready"
   [Phase changes to: SCREENING]
   Ava: "Great! Let's start with PHQ-9 Question #1..."
   ```

**Impact:** Better patient preparation, informed consent, reduced anxiety

## ‚úÖ Issue #3: Patient-Friendly PDF Version

**Problem:** Patients received clinical/technical PDF meant for providers

**Fixed:** `backend/app/services/pdf_service.py`
- Created new `generate_patient_report_pdf()` method
- Patient-friendly language:
  - "Your Mental Health Assessment Summary" (not "PSYCHNOW INTAKE ASSESSMENT REPORT")
  - "What Brought You Here Today" (not "CHIEF COMPLAINT")
  - "What You've Been Experiencing" (not "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS")
  - "Your Screening Results" with friendly names
  - "Your Next Steps" (not "RECOMMENDATIONS")
- Removed clinical jargon and technical details
- Added supportive message
- Simplified disclaimer

**Updated:** `backend/app/api/v1/intake.py`
- Changed to use `generate_patient_report_base64()` for patient downloads
- Clinical version (`generate_report_base64()`) still available for providers

**Impact:** Patients get accessible, encouraging reports; providers get clinical detail

---

## ‚úÖ Issue #4: Removed Duplicate Recommendations

**Problem:** PDF had both "RECOMMENDATIONS" and "TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS" sections with identical content

**Fixed:** `backend/app/services/pdf_service.py`
- Removed duplicate "RECOMMENDATIONS" section (lines 146-151)
- Kept only "TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS" for clinical PDF
- Patient PDF only has "Your Next Steps" (single section)

**Impact:** Professional appearance, no redundancy

## ‚úÖ Issue #5: User Context & Mid-Assessment Account Creation

**Problem:** No indication of who's signed in, no prompt to create account

**Fixed:**

### Frontend: `pychnow design/src/components/PatientIntake.tsx`

**1. User Context Display:**
- **Anonymous Users:** Shows "üíæ Create Account" button (green, prominent)
- **Authenticated Users:** Shows user badge with initial + name
- Mobile-optimized: Collapses to icons on small screens

**2. Create Account Modal:**
- Overlay modal (keeps assessment in background)
- Simple form: Name, Email, Password
- Cancel / Create Account buttons

**3. Seamless Account Creation Flow:**
```
Step 1: Patient clicks "Create Account"
Step 2: Modal opens with signup form
Step 3: Patient fills out (Name: "Sarah", Email, Password)
Step 4: System creates account + logs in
Step 5: System transfers anonymous session to new account
Step 6: System updates UI (shows "Sarah" badge)
Step 7: Ava acknowledges: "‚úÖ Account created! Welcome, Sarah..."
Step 8: Assessment continues seamlessly
```

**4. Session Transfer Logic:**
- Transfers `IntakeSession.patient_id` from anonymous ID to real user ID
- Updates conversation service with new user name
- Saves to localStorage (token, user_id, user_name)
- Removes temp_user_id

### Backend: `backend/app/api/v1/intake.py`

**New Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/intake/transfer-session`
- Takes: `session_token`, `new_user_id`, `user_name`
- Updates database session record
- Updates in-memory conversation session
- Injects user name into conversation context
- Returns confirmation

**Impact:**
- Higher conversion (capture engaged users)
- No interruption to clinical flow
- Ava uses real name going forward
- Saved assessments = returning users

---

## Mobile Optimizations

All header buttons adapt to screen size:
- Desktop: Full labels ("Create Account", "Take a Break", "Dashboard")
- Mobile: Icons only (üíæ, ‚è∏Ô∏è, üìä)
- User badge: Shows initials on mobile, full name on desktop
