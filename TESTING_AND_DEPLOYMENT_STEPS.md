## üîß **STEP 1: Database Migration** (5 minutes)

**You need to do this now:**

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\gbtol\PsychNow\backend"
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Create migration
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add dual reports and feedback system"

# Review the migration file in: backend/alembic/versions/XXXX_add_dual_reports_and_feedback_system.py
# Make sure it includes:
# - feedback_submissions table
# - Updates to intake_reports (patient_pdf_path, clinician_pdf_path, clinician_report_data, feedback_submitted)

# Apply migration
alembic upgrade head
```

**Verify it worked:**
```powershell
python
>>> from app.models.feedback import FeedbackSubmission
>>> from app.models.intake_report import IntakeReport
>>> print("Models imported successfully!")
>>> exit()
```

---

## üß™ **STEP 2: Local Testing** (30 minutes)

### **2A: Test Backend**

**In backend terminal:**
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\gbtol\PsychNow\backend"
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python main.py
```

**Verify endpoints exist:**
- Visit: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/docs
- Look for:
  - `/api/v1/feedback/submit` - Should be there!
  - `/api/v1/feedback/stats` - Should be there!
  - `/api/v1/intake/chat` - Should have updated response schema

### **2B: Test Frontend**

**In demo terminal:**
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\gbtol\PsychNow\psychnow-demo"
npm run dev
```

**Complete E2E Test:**
1. ‚úÖ Visit http://localhost:3001 (or 3002)
2. ‚úÖ Click "Start Demo Assessment"
3. ‚úÖ Complete conversation (or type `:finish` to skip)
4. ‚úÖ Watch for "Two report versions have been generated"
5. ‚úÖ Auto-navigate to feedback page
6. ‚úÖ See both download buttons (Patient + Clinician)
7. ‚úÖ Download both PDFs
8. ‚úÖ Open both PDFs - verify they're different!
9. ‚úÖ **Clinician PDF should be 2-3X longer**
10. ‚úÖ Fill out feedback form
11. ‚úÖ Submit feedback
12. ‚úÖ See success message

### **2C: Verify Emails** (If SMTP Configured)

**Check backend terminal for email logs:**
- After completing assessment: Should see "Assessment completion email sent"
- After submitting feedback: Should see "Feedback email sent"

**If SMTP not configured:**
- Emails will be logged only
- This is fine for local testing
- Will configure for production deployment

---

## üìß **STEP 3: Configure Email** (Optional for tomorrow)

### **Option A: Use Gmail** (Recommended for testing)

**Get Gmail App Password:**
1. Go to Google Account settings
2. Security ‚Üí 2-Step Verification
3. App passwords ‚Üí Generate
4. Copy the 16-character password

**Update backend/.env:**
```
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx
ADMIN_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@psychnow.com
```

**Restart backend** and test again!

### **Option B: Skip Email for Now**

If short on time:
- Leave SMTP settings blank
- Emails will be logged in backend console
- You can manually check for demo completions
- Still fully functional for clinician testing!

---

## üö¢ **STEP 4: Deploy to Production** (45-60 minutes)

### **4A: Update Environment for Render**

**In Render dashboard, add these environment variables:**

```
ADMIN_EMAIL=your-email@domain.com
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@psychnow.com
```

### **4B: Deploy Backend**

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\gbtol\PsychNow"
git add backend/
git commit -m "Add dual report generation and feedback system"
git push origin main
```

**Render will auto-deploy!** Watch the logs in Render dashboard.

**After deployment, run migration on Render:**
- Render Dashboard ‚Üí Your Service ‚Üí Shell
- Run: `alembic upgrade head`

### **4C: Deploy Frontend**

**Create production .env:**
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\gbtol\PsychNow\psychnow-demo"
echo VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com > .env.production
```

**Build and deploy:**
```powershell
npm run build
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

### **4D: Update CORS**

In Render dashboard, update `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`:
```
https://your-project.web.app,https://your-project.firebaseapp.com
```

1. ‚úÖ Complete full assessment
2. ‚úÖ Download both PDFs
3. ‚úÖ Verify PDFs are different
4. ‚úÖ Clinician PDF is more detailed
5. ‚úÖ Submit feedback
6. ‚úÖ Check your email for notifications

## üêõ **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Migration Fails**

```powershell
# If migration has issues, downgrade and try again
alembic downgrade -1
alembic upgrade head
```

### **Emails Not Sending**

**Check backend logs for:**
- "SMTP credentials not configured" ‚Üí Add SMTP settings to .env
- "Failed to send email" ‚Üí Check Gmail app password is correct
- Emails will be logged even if not sent

### **Both PDFs Identical**

**Issue:** Clinician report generation not working

**Fix:**
- Check backend logs for errors
- Verify `CLINICIAN_REPORT_GENERATION_PROMPT` exists in system_prompts.py
- Test report generation in isolation

### **Feedback Form Not Submitting**

**Check:**
- Browser console for errors
- All required fields filled (ratings and would_use)
- Backend `/api/v1/feedback/submit` endpoint accessible
- Session ID is being passed correctly
