# ⚡ START HERE - Your Action Plan

## 🎉 Demo is Built! Here's What to Do Right Now

### ✅ STEP 1: Test Locally (15 minutes)

Open **TWO** PowerShell terminals:

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\gbtol\PsychNow\backend"
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python main.py
```

Keep this running. You should see:
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

**Terminal 2 - Demo Frontend:**
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\gbtol\PsychNow\psychnow-demo"
npm install
npm run dev
```

Wait for it to open your browser at http://localhost:3001

**Test the demo:**
1. ✅ Landing page loads?
2. ✅ Click "Start Demo Assessment"
3. ✅ Ava greets you?
4. ✅ Type a message and hit Send
5. ✅ Ava responds?
6. ✅ Continue for 2-3 messages

**If all works → Proceed to Step 2**  
**If not → Check console for errors**

### ✅ STEP 2: Choose Your Path

**Option A: Deploy Today** (Recommended - Get live URL ASAP)
→ Go to `psychnow-demo/QUICK_START.md` and follow it step-by-step

**Option B: Deploy Tomorrow** (Test more first)
→ Keep testing locally, deploy in the morning before sending emails

---

### ✅ STEP 3: Prepare Emails (While Waiting for Deployment)

1. Open `CLINICIAN_EMAIL_TEMPLATE.md`
2. Save as `emails_to_send.txt` or similar
3. Replace these placeholders:
   - `[Clinician Name]` → Their actual name
   - `[YOUR-DEMO-URL.web.app]` → Your Firebase URL (you'll get after deploy)
   - `[your-email@domain.com]` → Your email
   - `[your-phone-number]` → Your phone (optional)
4. Personalize each email (mention how you know them, why their feedback matters)

---

### ✅ STEP 4: Set Up Tracking

Create a Google Sheet with these columns:

| Name | Specialty | Email | Sent | Completed | Feedback | Rating | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|------|-----------|----------|--------|-------|
| Dr. Smith | Psychiatrist | dr.smith@... | 10/4 | ✓ | 10/5 | 4.5/5 | Loved flow |

---

### ✅ STEP 5: Optional - Create Feedback Form

1. Go to https://forms.google.com
2. Click "+ Blank"
3. Use questions from `FEEDBACK_FORM_TEMPLATE.md`
4. Keep it to 20-25 questions max
5. Get shareable link
6. Add to email template

2. Give you confidence in what you're sharing
3. Help you explain it better to clinicians
4. Show you exactly what they'll experience
