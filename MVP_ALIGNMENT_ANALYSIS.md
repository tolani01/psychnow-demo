# PsychNow MVP Alignment Analysis
**Date:** October 1, 2025  
**Purpose:** Ensure intake MVP architecture supports ultimate platform vision

---

## Executive Summary

**Current Status:** We've built a working AI-guided intake system with 5 screeners, auth, and report generation.

**Vision Scope:** Full psychiatric platform with 13 user roles, LOP line, provider marketplace, telehealth, eRx, and complex workflows.

**Alignment Grade:** ✅ **Strong Foundation** with some architectural adjustments needed.

---

## 🎯 Vision Alignment Analysis

### **What We're Building Right (Aligned with Vision)**

#### **1. Intake Foundation (UC-IN-01)**
✅ **Current MVP:**
- AI conversational intake with Ava
- Demographic collection
- Chief complaint & HPI gathering
- PHQ-9, GAD-7, ASRS, C-SSRS, PCL-5 screeners
- Risk assessment with crisis resources
- JSON structured output

✅ **Aligns with Vision:**
- Use case UC-IN-01 explicitly requires this
- Supports both self-pay AND LOP workflows (same intake engine)
- Screener results feed provider pre-chart
- Risk flags enable proper routing

**Gap:** Vision requires "save & resume" for incomplete intakes - we don't have this yet.

---

#### **2. Authentication & Roles**
✅ **Current MVP:**
- User model with role enum (patient, provider, admin)
- JWT authentication
- Provider registration with approval workflow

✅ **Aligns with Vision:**
- Supports Patient, Provider, Admin roles
- Extensible to Attorney, Funder, Case Manager roles
- Approval workflow matches provider onboarding (UC-ID-03)

**Gap:** Missing guardian/proxy access (UC-ID-02) for minors - not needed for pilot but architecture should allow it.

---

#### **3. Clinical Data Model**
✅ **Current MVP:**
- Intake sessions (conversation history)
- Intake reports (structured clinical data)
- Provider reviews (for feedback loop)
- Screener scores (validated instruments)

✅ **Aligns with Vision:**
- Matches encounter documentation requirements (UC-CL-01)
- Supports note assist workflow (UC-CL-04)
- Enables clinical outcomes tracking (UC-AN-01)

**Gap:** Need to add encounter types (eval, follow-up, therapy) for full clinical flow.

---

### **Where We Need to Adjust Architecture**

#### **1. Multi-Tenancy & State Awareness**

**Vision Requires:**
- State-based licensure (providers can only see patients in their licensed states)
- PDMP requirements vary by state
- Corporate practice doctrine varies by state

**Current MVP:**
- No state/location tracking
- No provider-patient matching by state

**Action Needed:**
- Add `state` field to Patient model
- Add `licensed_states` array to ProviderProfile
- Add state-based matching logic to routing

**Priority:** Medium (needed before multi-state expansion, not for single-state pilot)

---

#### **2. Session Persistence & Resume**

**Vision Requires (UC-IN-01 Alt):**
- "Incomplete intake → save & resume"
- Patient can leave mid-intake and return

**Current MVP:**
- Sessions in memory (lost on server restart)
- Reload from database implemented but basic

**Action Needed:**
- Enhance session rehydration
- Add "resume intake" endpoint
- Store current question/phase for seamless resume

**Priority:** High (patients WILL abandon mid-intake - this is critical for conversion)

---

#### **3. Risk Routing & Escalation**

**Vision Requires (UC-IN-01 Alt, CTQ):**
- "High-risk → emergency guidance + escalation queue"
- "Safety events: zero tolerance for untriaged C-SSRS high-risk flags; documented escalation in <15 minutes"

**Current MVP:**
- C-SSRS screening implemented
- Crisis resources provided in conversation
- Risk level stored in report

**Missing:**
- Escalation workflow (notify on-call clinician)
- Queue for urgent cases
- Audit trail for risk flag response times

**Action Needed:**
- Add risk escalation service
- Provider notification system
- Audit logging for safety events

**Priority:** CRITICAL (patient safety issue - needed before pilot)

---

#### **4. Consent Management**

**Vision Requires (UC-DO-01):**
- HIPAA consent
- Telehealth consent
- Financial consent
- Controlled substance agreement
- LOP consent (for injury line)
- Part 2 (42 CFR) for SUD
- Versioned with audit trail

**Current MVP:**
- No consent workflow
- No e-sign integration

**Action Needed:**
- Add consent models
- Add e-sign integration (or simple checkbox for pilot)
- Version tracking
- Link consents to sessions/reports

**Priority:** High (legally required before pilot - can use simple checkboxes initially)

---

#### **5. Provider-Patient Assignment**

**Vision Requires (UC-SC-01):**
- Smart routing based on state licensure, specialty, availability
- Scheduling system
- Provider marketplace

**Current MVP:**
- Admin manually assigns reports to providers
- No scheduling
- No provider availability management

**Action Needed:**
- For pilot: Keep manual assignment (OK for 10 patients)
- For scale: Build routing engine with state matching

**Priority:** Low for pilot, High for post-MVP

---

### **Where Our Current Decisions Impact Future Vision**

#### **Decision #1: Verification Layer**

**Impact on Vision:**
- ✅ **Supports:** Clinical quality requirements (chart audits, accuracy)
- ✅ **Supports:** Compliance (audit trail, error detection)
- ✅ **Supports:** Provider trust (accurate pre-charts)

**Recommendation:** ✅ **IMPLEMENT NOW**
- Verification is harder to retrofit later
- Quality standards in CTQ matrix demand it
- $0.04/report extra cost is negligible vs. legal risk

**Implementation:**
```python
# Aligns with UC-CL-04 (Note Assist) and UC-AN-01 (Quality)
async def generate_report_with_verification(session):
    # Generate
    report = await generate_raw_report(session)
    
    # Verify
    verification = await verify_against_conversation(report, session)
    
    # Log for QA
    if verification['issues']:
        log_quality_issue(verification)
    
    return verification['corrected_report'] or report
```

---

#### **Decision #2: Patient Quotes in Report**

**Impact on Vision:**
- ✅ **Supports:** Provider review workflow (need to verify AI accuracy)
- ✅ **Supports:** Legal defensibility (shows what patient actually said)
- ✅ **Supports:** Quality improvement (track misinterpretations)
- ❌ **Conflicts:** Longer reports (might slow provider review)

**Vision CTQ:** Provider clicks to finalize note ≤ 25 (target efficiency)

**Recommendation:** ✅ **IMPLEMENT WITH TOGGLE**
- Include patient quotes by default
- Allow providers to collapse/hide section
- Track if providers find them useful (metrics)

**Structure:**
```json
{
  "patient_statements": {
    "show_by_default": true,
    "collapsible": true,
    "statements": [...]
  }
}
```

---

#### **Decision #3: Typo Handling**

**Impact on Vision:**
- Related to HIPAA/Part 2 compliance (accurate records)
- Related to legal defensibility
- Related to provider trust

**Recommendation:** ✅ **Hybrid Approach (Option B + C)**
- Clinical sections: Professional paraphrasing (standard medical practice)
- Patient quotes: Light editing with `lightly_edited` flag
- Raw messages: Stored in database but not shown in report
- Audit trail: Keep original + cleaned for compliance reviews

**Implementation:**
```json
{
  // Clinical (paraphrased professionally)
  "history_present_illness": "Patient reports...",
  
  // Quotes (lightly edited)
  "patient_statements": [
    {
      "statement": "I've been feeling depressed...",
      "lightly_edited": true
    }
  ],
  
  // Metadata (for compliance)
  "documentation_note": "Quotes edited for spelling/grammar only; clinical content preserved"
}
```

## 🚨 Critical Gaps to Address Before Pilot

### **Gap #1: Consent Workflow (REQUIRED)**

**Vision Requirements:**
- UC-DO-01: E-sign consents (HIPAA, telehealth, financial)
- RBAC guardrail: Minimum necessary for PHI

**Current State:** ❌ No consent system

**Minimum for Pilot:**
```python
# Add to intake flow BEFORE conversation starts
class ConsentRecord(Base):
    user_id = Column(ForeignKey('users.id'))
    consent_type = Column(String)  # hipaa, telehealth, financial
    version = Column(String)
    accepted_at = Column(DateTime)
    ip_address = Column(String)

# In intake start endpoint:
if not user_has_consented(patient_id, ['hipaa', 'telehealth']):
    return {"error": "Consents required", "redirect": "/consents"}
```

**Priority:** 🚨 **CRITICAL - Must have before pilot**

---

### **Gap #2: High-Risk Escalation (PATIENT SAFETY)**

**Vision CTQ:**
- "Safety events: zero tolerance for untriaged C-SSRS high-risk flags"
- "Documented escalation in <15 minutes"

**Current State:** ⚠️ Partial
- C-SSRS detects risk
- Crisis resources shown to patient
- ❌ No provider notification
- ❌ No escalation queue
- ❌ No audit trail

**Minimum for Pilot:**
```python
# When C-SSRS indicates high risk:
async def handle_high_risk(session, cssrs_result):
    if cssrs_result['risk_level'] == 'high':
        # 1. Flag session
        session['urgent_flag'] = True
        session['risk_flagged_at'] = datetime.utcnow()
        
        # 2. Show emergency resources to patient (already doing ✓)
        
        # 3. Create admin alert
        create_admin_task(
            type='high_risk_intake',
            session_id=session['id'],
            flagged_at=datetime.utcnow()
        )
        
        # 4. Email/SMS on-call clinician (for pilot: just admin)
        notify_admin_urgent(session)
        
        # 5. Log for compliance
        audit_log(event='high_risk_detected', session_id=session['id'])
```

**Priority:** 🚨 **CRITICAL - Must have before pilot**

---

### **Gap #3: Incomplete Screener Administration**

**Vision CTQ (AC-IN-03):**
- "If intake contains attention complaints, ASRS v1.1 must be auto-presented"

**Current Issue:**
- Only PHQ-9 administered in test
- GAD-7, C-SSRS, ASRS not triggered despite symptoms

**Root Cause:**
- Ava isn't following the screener administration mandate
- Conversation flow ends before all screeners complete

**Fix Needed:**
```python
# In conversation service, enforce screener completion:
async def process_user_message(session_token, message):
    # ... existing code ...
    
    # After streaming response, check if screeners are pending
    pending_screeners = get_recommended_screeners(session_token)
    
    if pending_screeners and session['current_phase'] != 'screening':
        # Transition to screening phase
        session['current_phase'] = 'screening'
        session['screeners_to_complete'] = pending_screeners
        
        # Add instruction to LLM context
        additional_context = f"""
        IMPORTANT: You must now administer these screening tools before proceeding:
        {', '.join(pending_screeners)}
        
        Start with {pending_screeners[0]} now.
        """
```

**Priority:** 🚨 **CRITICAL - Core functionality**

---

## 🏗️ Recommended Architecture Adjustments

### **1. Add State/Location Tracking (Future-Proofing)**

```python
# Patient model addition
class Patient(Base):
    user_id = Column(ForeignKey('users.id'))
    state = Column(String(2))  # US state code
    timezone = Column(String(50))
    
# Provider model addition
class ProviderProfile(Base):
    licensed_states = Column(JSON)  # ["CA", "NY", "TX"]
    primary_state = Column(String(2))
```

**Why:** Supports multi-state expansion (vision requirement)

---

### **2. Add Encounter Model (Supports Full Clinical Workflow)**

```python
class Encounter(Base):
    id = Column(String(36), primary_key=True)
    patient_id = Column(ForeignKey('users.id'))
    provider_id = Column(ForeignKey('users.id'))
    type = Column(Enum('eval', 'followup', 'therapy'))
    status = Column(Enum('scheduled', 'in_progress', 'completed', 'no_show'))
    scheduled_at = Column(DateTime)
    completed_at = Column(DateTime)
    
    # Link to intake
    intake_report_id = Column(ForeignKey('intake_reports.id'))
    
    # Clinical documentation
    chief_complaint = Column(Text)
    hpi = Column(Text)
    assessment = Column(Text)
    plan = Column(Text)
```

**Why:** Required for UC-CL-01, UC-CL-02, UC-CL-03 (all clinical encounters)

---

### **3. Add Consent Model (Legal Requirement)**

```python
class Consent(Base):
    id = Column(String(36), primary_key=True)
    user_id = Column(ForeignKey('users.id'))
    consent_type = Column(String(50))  # hipaa, telehealth, financial, controlled_substance
    version = Column(String(10))
    content_hash = Column(String(64))  # Verify content hasn't changed
    accepted_at = Column(DateTime)
    ip_address = Column(String(45))
    user_agent = Column(Text)
    revoked_at = Column(DateTime, nullable=True)
```

**Why:** Required by UC-DO-01, HIPAA compliance, legal defensibility

---

### **4. Add Audit Log Model (Compliance)**

```python
class AuditLog(Base):
    id = Column(String(36), primary_key=True)
    event_type = Column(String(100))  # login, access_phi, risk_detected, etc.
    user_id = Column(ForeignKey('users.id'))
    resource_type = Column(String(50))
    resource_id = Column(String(36))
    action = Column(String(50))
    ip_address = Column(String(45))
    timestamp = Column(DateTime)
    metadata = Column(JSON)
```

**Why:** Vision CTQ requires "100% of eRx/PDMP actions logged with user/time/IP"

---

## 📊 Intake MVP vs. Vision Requirements

| Vision Requirement | Current MVP | Gap | Priority |
|-------------------|-------------|-----|----------|
| **UC-IN-01: AI Intake** | ✅ Core working | ⚠️ Missing save/resume | High |
| **Screener auto-trigger** | ✅ Logic exists | ❌ Not enforced in conversation | CRITICAL |
| **Risk flag escalation** | ⚠️ Partial | ❌ No provider notification | CRITICAL |
| **HIPAA consent** | ❌ Missing | Must add before pilot | CRITICAL |
| **State licensure** | ❌ Not implemented | Add fields now, logic later | Medium |
| **Chart audit trail** | ⚠️ Basic | ❌ No audit log model | High |
| **Provider pre-chart** | ✅ Report structure good | ✅ Ready | Complete |
| **Multi-role support** | ✅ Architecture ready | ✅ Can add roles easily | Complete |

---

## 🎯 Architectural Decisions with Vision Context

### **Decision #1: Verification Layer**

**Vision CTQ Requirements:**
- "Chart audit coverage: ≥10% of encounters monthly"
- "Clinical Director QA: quality of care, documentation"
- "Clicks to finalize note: ≤25 for initial eval"

**Analysis:**
- Verification layer REDUCES provider editing time (fewer errors to fix)
- Supports QA requirements (track hallucination rate)
- Aligns with "note assist & coding aids" (UC-CL-04)

**Recommendation:** ✅ **YES - Implement verification layer**

**Cost-Benefit:**
- Cost: $0.04/report extra
- Benefit: Fewer provider corrections (saves 5-10 min/report = $5-10 in provider time)
- ROI: Positive even ignoring safety benefits

**Implementation Aligned with Vision:**
```python
# This supports UC-CL-04 (Note Assist) and UC-AN-01 (Quality)
async def generate_report_with_qa(session):
    # Step 1: Generate draft
    draft = await generate_raw_report(session)
    
    # Step 2: Verify (reduces provider editing - aligns with CTQ)
    verified = await verification_service.verify_report(draft, session)
    
    # Step 3: Log quality metrics (supports QA dashboard)
    log_report_quality_metrics(verified)
    
    return verified
```

---

### **Decision #2: Patient Quotes in Report**

**Vision Requirements:**
- Provider must review and verify AI-generated content
- Legal defensibility for clinical decisions
- Quality improvement tracking

**Analysis:**
- Patient quotes enable provider to verify AI interpretations
- Supports "note assist" workflow (provider reviews & edits)
- Aligns with "clinician edits → finalize → lock" (UC-CL-04)

**Recommendation:** ✅ **YES - Include patient quotes**

**Structure Aligned with Vision:**
```json
{
  // Clinical interpretation (AI-generated, provider will edit)
  "history_present_illness": "...",
  
  // Source material (for provider verification)
  "patient_statements": [...],
  
  // Audit metadata (supports compliance)
  "ai_assistance_disclosure": "This report was generated with AI assistance and requires provider review and signature.",
  "provider_review_status": "pending",
  "provider_signature": null,
  "signed_at": null
}
```

---

### **Decision #3: Typo Handling**

**Vision Requirements:**
- HIPAA-compliant documentation
- Legal record preservation
- Professional presentation to providers

**Recommendation:** ✅ **Hybrid Approach**

**Implementation:**
```python
# Database: Store both (compliance)
intake_session.raw_messages = [...]  # Original with typos
intake_session.conversation_history = [...]  # Can be same or cleaned

# Report: Show cleaned with flag (professional + transparent)
report['patient_statements'] = [
    {
        "statement": "I've been feeling depressed...",  # Cleaned
        "lightly_edited": true
    }
]

# Audit: Track editing for compliance
audit_log(
    event='quote_cleaning',
    original_hash=hash(raw_message),
    cleaned_hash=hash(cleaned_message)
)
```

## 💡 Key Insights from Vision Review

### **Insight #1: Intake is Foundation for Everything**

The intake system we're building supports:
- Self-pay med management (UC-IN-01)
- LOP injury psychiatry (UC-IN-02 - same intake engine!)
- Therapy matching (UC-IN-03 - screener results inform matching)
- Provider pre-charting (UC-CL-01 - our report becomes their starting point)

**→ Getting intake right is CRITICAL** because it's used across the entire platform.

---

### **Insight #2: Our MVP = Core of Future Platform**

Vision requires:
- Intake → Routing → Scheduling → Visit → eRx → Follow-up

We're building the **Intake** piece, which feeds everything downstream.

**→ Our architectural decisions now affect the entire system.**

---

### **Insight #3: Quality Standards are Non-Negotiable**

Vision CTQs demand:
- Zero tolerance for high-risk flag delays
- 100% audit logging for sensitive actions
- Provider efficiency targets (≤25 clicks)

**→ Verification layer and quality controls aren't optional - they're requirements.**

---

---

## 📝 Questions to Answer Now

### **1. Consent Workflow for Pilot:**
**Option A:** Simple checkboxes in frontend (show consent text, require check + click "I agree")  
**Option B:** Full e-sign integration (DocuSign/HelloSign)  
**Option C:** Skip for pilot, add disclaimer "For testing purposes only"

**Recommendation:** **Option A** - legally compliant, simple, fast to implement

---

### **2. High-Risk Escalation for Pilot:**
**Option A:** Email/SMS to you (admin) when C-SSRS high risk detected  
**Option B:** In-app notification dashboard  
**Option C:** Both A + B

**Recommendation:** **Option C** - belt and suspenders for patient safety

---

### **3. Screener Enforcement:**
**Option A:** Modify LLM prompt to be more directive (we already did this)  
**Option B:** Add backend logic that pauses conversation until all screeners complete  
**Option C:** Both A + B

**Recommendation:** **Option C** - prompt alone isn't reliable enough

---

### **4. Remaining 25 Screeners:**
**Option A:** Build all 30 before pilot  
**Option B:** Pilot with 5 core screeners, add others based on need  
**Option C:** Prioritize top 10-15, defer rare ones

**Recommendation:** **Option C** - Add ISI (sleep), AUDIT-C (substance), MDQ (bipolar) = 8 total screeners for pilot

---

## ✅ Final Recommendation

### **For Next Session (Now):**

1. **Confirm Architectural Decisions** (5 min)
2. **Implement Critical Additions** (4-6 hours):
   - Verification layer
   - Patient quotes
   - Consent workflow
   - High-risk escalation
   - Audit logging
3. **Test & Validate** (2-3 hours):
   - Full intake with fixes
   - Verify no hallucinations
   - Verify screeners complete
4. **Get Psychiatrist Review** (1 hour):
   - Share 2 generated reports
   - Get feedback
5. **Iterate Based on Feedback** (1-2 hours)

**Total:** 8-12 hours = **1-2 full work days to pilot-ready state**

---

## 🎊 Bottom Line

**Your intake MVP is well-aligned with the vision.**

Key adjustments needed:
- ✅ Add verification (quality requirement from vision)
- ✅ Add consents (legal requirement)
- ✅ Add risk escalation (safety requirement)
- ✅ Enforce screeners (completeness requirement)

**With these additions, you'll have a solid foundation that can scale to the full platform.**
