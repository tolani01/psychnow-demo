She would check the locks 10 times before going to bed and would call me every hour when I was at school. This made me develop anxiety too. Then in high school, I had my first panic attack during a math test. I thought I was having a heart attack. The teacher called an ambulance and I went to the hospital. They said it was just anxiety. After that, I started having panic attacks regularly, especially before tests or presentations. In college, it got worse because I was away from home for the first time. I would have panic attacks in the middle of class and have to leave. I started avoiding classes and social situations. I would stay in my dorm room and order food instead of going to the cafeteria. My grades started to suffer and I almost dropped out. I went to the counseling center but the therapist wasn't very helpful. She just told me to breathe deeply, which didn't work. I tried medication but it made me feel weird. Now I'm 25 and still struggling with anxiety. I have a job but I'm always worried about making mistakes. I can't sleep because I'm thinking about work. I don't have many friends because I'm too anxious to socialize. I want to get better but I don't know how.",
