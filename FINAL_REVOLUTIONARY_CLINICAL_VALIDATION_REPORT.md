## 🔧 SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS IMPLEMENTED

### **1. Enhanced System Prompts**
```python
# Added condition-specific assessment protocols
CLINICAL CONDITION ASSESSMENT PROTOCOL:
- IMMEDIATELY identify likely clinical conditions
- Ask condition-specific follow-up questions
- Assess symptom duration, severity, functional impairment
- Rule out differential diagnoses
- Document clinical reasoning

CONDITION-SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT GUIDELINES:
- MDD: mood, anhedonia, sleep, appetite, energy, concentration
- GAD: excessive worry, restlessness, fatigue, muscle tension
- PTSD: trauma exposure, re-experiencing, avoidance, hypervigilance
- Bipolar: mood episodes, elevated energy, decreased sleep
- ADHD: inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, executive function
- Schizophrenia: hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech
```

### **2. Comprehensive Symptom Detection**
```python
# Enhanced clinical condition detection
- MDD: 13 specific keywords including anhedonia, suicidal ideation
- GAD: 14 specific keywords including muscle tension, irritability
- PTSD: 8 trauma-specific keywords including flashbacks, avoidance
- Bipolar: 12 mood-specific keywords including racing thoughts
- ADHD: 11 attention-specific keywords including executive function
- Schizophrenia: 10 psychosis-specific keywords including delusions
```

### **3. DSM-5 Domain Requirements**
```python
REQUIRED_DSM5_DOMAINS = [
    "chief_complaint", "hpi_duration_severity_course",
    "risk_suicide_homicide_means_protective", "psychosis_screen",
    "mania_hypomania_screen", "past_psych_history",
    "meds_trials_allergies", "medical_history",
    "substance_history", "family_history",
