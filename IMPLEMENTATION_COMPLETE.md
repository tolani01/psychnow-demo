## üöÄ **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (DO NOW)**

### **1. Run Database Migration** (5 minutes)

**In your backend terminal** (where Python is running):

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the server, then:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\gbtol\PsychNow\backend"
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add dual reports and feedback system"
alembic upgrade head

# Should see: "Running upgrade ... -> XXXX, Add dual reports and feedback system"
```

**Then restart backend:**
```powershell
python main.py
```

---

### **2. Test End-to-End** (15 minutes)

**Backend should still be running in Terminal 1**

**In Terminal 2 (demo frontend):**
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\gbtol\PsychNow\psychnow-demo"
npm run dev
```

**Browser Test:**
1. Go to http://localhost:3001 (or 3002)
2. Click "Start Demo Assessment"
3. Type `:finish` to skip to report generation
4. Wait ~10 seconds for both reports to generate
5. Should auto-navigate to feedback page
6. Click **both download buttons**
7. Open both PDFs side-by-side
8. **Verify clinician PDF is longer and more detailed!**
9. Fill out feedback form:
   - Rate: 5, 4, 5 stars
   - Would use: "Yes, probably"
   - Strength: "Test"
   - Concern: "Test"
10. Submit feedback
11. See success message

**Check backend terminal:**
- Should see: "‚úÖ Assessment completion email sent"
- Should see: "‚úÖ Feedback email sent"
- (Or "‚ö†Ô∏è SMTP not configured" - that's fine!)

---

### **3. Configure Email (Optional - 10 minutes)**

**If you want email notifications working:**

1. **Get Gmail App Password:**
   - Google Account ‚Üí Security ‚Üí 2-Step Verification ‚Üí App Passwords
   - Generate password for "Mail"
   - Copy the 16-character code

2. **Open `backend\.env` in Notepad:**
   ```powershell
   notepad backend\.env
   ```

3. **Add these lines at the bottom:**
   ```
   SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   SMTP_PORT=587
   SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   SMTP_PASSWORD=xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx
   ADMIN_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
   FROM_EMAIL=noreply@psychnow.com
   ```

4. **Save and close**

5. **Restart backend** (Ctrl+C, then `python main.py`)

6. **Test again** - you should receive 2 emails!

## üìß **EMAIL TEMPLATE FOR TOMORROW**

Subject: PsychNow Demo - Your Clinical Input Needed (20 min)

---

Dear [Dr. Name],

I'm reaching out to share a demo of PsychNow, an AI-guided psychiatric assessment platform, and would be incredibly grateful for your clinical expertise.

**üîó Demo Link:** [YOUR-DEMO-URL.web.app]

**Time Required:** 15-20 minutes

**What You'll Do:**
1. Complete the AI-guided assessment (as if you were a patient)
2. Review **two report versions**:
   - üìã Patient Report - Compassionate, accessible summary
   - ü©∫ Clinician Report - Comprehensive clinical assessment with diagnostic reasoning
3. Provide quick feedback via built-in form (2 minutes)

**Why Two Reports?**
You'll be able to evaluate both patient communication AND clinical utility for your workflow.

**What I'm Looking For:**
- Is the conversation clinically appropriate and empathetic?
- Is the patient report helpful for patients?
- Does the clinician report support your decision-making?
- Would you use this in your practice?
- What's missing or needs improvement?

The feedback form appears immediately after the assessment - super quick and easy!

**Your input will directly determine whether this moves forward to broader testing.**

Thank you for considering!

Best regards,  
[Your Name]  
[Your Email]  
[Your Phone - Optional]

P.S. Questions? Feel free to call or email anytime!
